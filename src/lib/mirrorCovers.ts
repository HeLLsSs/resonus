/**
 * Covers for what the library mirror keeps.
 *
 * The mirror is what makes the Library readable without a connection: what you
 * favourited, your playlists, the albums you opened. Their covers, though, were
 * only ever a URL to the server, so offline they either came out of the image
 * loader's cache or not at all. That cache is not ours: it has a size and it
 * evicts, so on a large library most of it was gone and the shelves came out as
 * grey squares.
 *
 * So the covers are saved on purpose, next to the mirror and by the same rule:
 * while online, whatever is written to the mirror gets its cover fetched once,
 * small, and from then on it is a file on disk like a download's. Nothing is
 * crawled ahead of time; this only follows what you were already looking at.
 *
 * Albums, playlists and artists, which is what the shelves are made of, plus
 * the album behind each song a playlist or the favourites keep. Never a song's
 * own cover id: on a server that gives every track one, that would be a file
 * per track, and offline the rows ask for their album's picture instead (see
 * `songCoverUrl`). That last part used to be assumed rather than done, which
 * is why a playlist offline was a column of grey squares.
